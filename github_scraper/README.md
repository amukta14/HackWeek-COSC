# GitHub Trending Scraper

This Python script scrapes the top 5 trending repositories from [GitHub's Trending page](https://github.com/trending). It extracts the repository names and their corresponding links and saves them into a `trending_repos.csv` file.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```

This will generate a `trending_repos.csv` file in the same directory.
